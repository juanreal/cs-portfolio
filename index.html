Here we see a left push kick to the face that will leave the guy knocked out. A knock out is when the brain moves in the scull and gets hurt the brain is not designed to get hurt like that so the body will fall and that is a knock out.

The guy who is in the ground got knocked out and the guys that knocked him out will give the guy in the ground a punch to the face with grate force.
